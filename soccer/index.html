            <h2> Inspiration</h2>
            <p> The that inspired me is my dad he would show me and my bother games and would play with us when we were little. He would come home and play with
            us. we had a lot of fun and when my parents split we would go over to his house and just play, go to the park he would kinda train us but in the most funnest way. </p>
